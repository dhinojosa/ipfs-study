# Interplanetary Filesystem

## Problem: Inefficiency
* Distributed servers to download documentation
* Possible to efficiently distribute high volumes of data

## Total Persistence
* Average lifespan of documentation is 100 days
* IPFS provides longer lifespans
* IPFS keeps every version of your files

## No Centralization
* Avoidance of all centralization
* Open and flat, no central leader

## No Internet Backbone
* Diverse, Resilient Networks
* Better Connectivity
* Failure Tolerant

## Tools to Get Started
* [IPFS Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop) to store files
